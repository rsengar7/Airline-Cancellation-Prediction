# Airline-Cancellation-Prediction-Analysis
### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts airline cancellations based on selected attributes. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models using PySpark. Different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and GBT Classifier, are employed. The models are evaluated using cross-validation and parameter grid search to identify the best-performing model.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Model Development
- Model Evaluation (Cross-Validation and Parameter Grid Search)

### Interpretation
The project includes interpretation of model results and justifications for predictions.
